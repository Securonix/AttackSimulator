Quartz plugin allows your Grails application to schedule jobs to be executed using a specified interval or cron expression. The underlying system uses the [Quartz Enterprise Job Scheduler|http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/] configured via Spring, but is made simpler by the coding by convention paradigm.
Since 1.0-RC3 this plugin requires Quartz 2.1.x and no longer supports Quartz 1.8.x.
